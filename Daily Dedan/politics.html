<p>Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru yesterday got a repreive after a court temporarily halted her impeachment process. High court<br>
 judge Weldon Korir ruled that the county assembly shold stop the ouster plan until the coronavirus pandemic is contained</p>
<p>Mr Korir said holding the impeachment proceeding at this time will prejudice Governor Waiguru's political rights. "In my view, 
<br>the unique circumstances posed by the Covid-19 pandemic imposes a duty to the court to interfere with the county 
<br>assembly's mandate in as far as the impeachment proceeding is concerned; the governor's rights are threatened as
<br> the doctrine of public participation will be violated," the court ruled.</p>
<p>Ms Waiguru had argued that she is complying with the national government's directive for people to work from home.
<br> <strong>The judge</strong> noted that impeachment plan requires the governor and her lawyer to present themselves before the assembly.
<br> The court said it is evident that public participation will be affected by the pandemic yet residents must
<br> be involved through <q>qualitative and quantitive participation</q></p>

<h2>Five MPs lash out at Tuju for 'meddling' in assembly operations</h2>
<p>Five Jubilee MPs have lashed out at a party secretary-general Raphael Tuju for allegedly interfering with the operations of
<br> the Kirinyaga County Assembly.They accused Mr Tuju of intimidating ward reps over their plan to impeach Ms Waiguru.
<p>Mr Tuju had asked MCAs to first exhaust all internal party dispute-resolution mechanisms before filing an impeachment motion,
<br> warning that such a move would impinge on the party's national agenda. Speaking in Sagana, the MPs said the majority leader
<br> was elected by MCAs and only they can remove him office. "We have also seen a letter from the secretary-general which
<br> appears to intimidate all jubilee MCAs, particularly the nominated ones," Mr Wambugu said.</p>
