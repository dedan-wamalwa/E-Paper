<p>Revenue collection by the 47 counties dipped marginally in the six months to December 2019 compared to similar period in the<br> 2018/19 fiscal year, highlighting the continued struggles by the devolved units to become self-sustaining. The Controller of Budget<br>(CoB) in the report for the first six month period shows the counties raised Sh15.33 billion, a fall of 0.3 percent from the similar <br>period in 2018/19. The drop continues to hurt delivery of key services like health, water, sewarage and roads.</p>
<p>The near-flat perfomance comes at a time the Treasury has unveilled plans to assist counties increase their collections, including<br> automation and deploying the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to collect. The analysis of the CoB data shows that Narok at<br> 63.1%, Isiolo (56.3%) and Samburu at 56.1% achieved the highest proportions of targeted annual collections. The Sh15.33<br> billion total collection, however, remains the second highest raised in the first six months of a financial year since<br> start of devolution in 2014 while the lowest remains Sh9 billion raised in the first year of devolution. The KRA<br> last month started collecting taxes on behalf of Nairobi County following the transfer of health services,<br> transport, planning and development and public works and utilities to the State and this is<br> expected to increase the county's own-source revenue.</p>

<h2>Banks to publish loans relief list</h2>
<p>Banks have up to Friday this week to submit details of all loans renegotiated under the payment relief to support businesses<br> and individuals during the coronavirus pandemic. The Central Bank of Kenya has put strict measures to track loans<br> that will be given extension including monthly reports by lenders with details showing why the relief was offered,<br> monitoring meausres and set timelines for loans revert to normal. Lenders will meet all the costs of restructuring <br>and must submit returns on 10th of each succeeding month, reads a CBK circular. The CBK said individuals and <br>small businesses seeking amnesty must prove that the inability to pay is directly tied to the effects of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Banks will then be allowed to restructure the loans without affecting the quality of loan books as they will be exempt<br> from prudential guidelines on classifying non-performing loans. Normally banks are required to set aside part of profits<br> to cover non-performing loans, hence a cost to the bank. As of December last year, Kenyans had defaulted on Sh331.3 <br>billion, 12% of the total Sh2.774 trillion outstanding loans.</p>
