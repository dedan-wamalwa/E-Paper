<h2>WEARING A MASK KEY TO FIGHTING CORONAVIRUS</h2>
<h3>WHO has revised its stand, saying masks can limit spread of the viral disease</h3>
<p>With the daily spike in the cases of the corona virus, wearing of masks-in addition to other preventive measures like staying at home, <br>handwashing and keeping social distance-might help slow down the spread of covid-19.</p>
<p>Yesterday,the World Health Organization (WHO) revised its stand on masks, acknowledging that wearing a mask is one of <br>the prevention measures to limit the spread of the virus.The revision came after months of dithering on the issue despite<br>  mounting evidence that countries that adopted the use of masks for everyone,such as China, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and <br>Taiwan, have slowed down the lethal itinerary of covid-19 as compared to the United States and Europe. They recorded fewer<br> infections and deaths.<p>

<strong><small><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO </abbr></strong> Boss <strong>Tedros Adhanos</strong> has revised their earlier stance on wearing masks</small>
<p>Even before WHO's advisory,Health Cabinet Secretary had called on Kenyans to wear masks outdoors to stop the spread of the virus.<br> Dr. Patrick Oyaro, an epidemiologist and a public health expert, explained how face masks prevent diseases.</p>
<p>He told the <i>Nation</i> that masks are "a physical barrier" which catch tiny organisms (microbes) that the sick person may expel to the<br> environment. Masks also protect the healthy from inhaling the germs in the environment</p>
<p>More evidence is also coming that covid-19 could be airborne,and that mere act of talking and breathing releases this pathogenic<br> germs to the air which one can breathe and get infected.</p>
