<h2>Stakeholders want action taken before next planting season in Agricultural areas</h2>
<p>Residents of Laikipia county are staring at a food crisis after their crops were destroyed by desert locusts and wild animals.<br> The county is home to plantations where some of the country's best agricultural efforts have been demonstrated.<br> Among the areas that throughout the years have been receiving bumper harvests, producing horticultural<br> produce, wheat, maize and other cereals are Ng'arua , Marmanet, Igwamiti, Sipili, Salama and Sironi.
<p>As a substantial agricultural county, we were expecting a bumper harvest this season because we had received favourable <br>rains last year but we have however lost alot of our farm produce to desert locusts" said Ms Rebeca Wambui,<br> a farmer in Shamanei. The farmers-who claimed they had been left to fight the swarms of locusts, which<br> are still ravaging some farms, with little help from the government-say the insects now pose <br>a danger to food production in the region.</p>
<p>Locusts continue to ravage parts of North Rift as the government shifts its attention to fighting Covid-19 pandemic posing<br> a threat to food security of the country. Kenya Farmer's Association director Kipkorir Menjo said now that the focus<br> had shifted to the pandemic, swarms spotted in Kapseret, Moiben and Ainabkoi recently if they continue will<br> lead to a food crisis if nothing is done. Turkana County is on high alert for a possible invasion, nine months <br>after the devolved unit spent Sh27 million to control the insects across its six constituencies.
